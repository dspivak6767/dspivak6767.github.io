        <h2>My Plans After High School</h2>
        <p>
            After high school, I want to study business, especially finance, because I enjoy working with numbers and understanding how money flows in the economy.
            I am excited to learn about investing, budgeting, and how businesses grow.

        <h2>Unit 1: Data and Information</h2>
        <p>
            In Unit 1, we learned about how computers store and use information. A <b>bit</b> is the smallest piece of data, either a 0 or 1, and a <b>byte</b> is made of 8 bits.
            Sometimes computers have <b>roundoff</b> errors when they can't store a number exactly because there aren't enough bits.
            We also talked about <b>analog data</b>, which is data that changes smoothly like music or temperature, and how computers turn it into digital data.
            We studied <b>lossless</b> compression, which keeps all the original data when compressing, and <b>lossy</b> compression, which throws away some data to make files smaller.
            Finally, we learned about <b>metadata</b>, which is data about data, like the author or date of a file.

        <h2>Unit 2: The Internet</h2>
        <p>
            Unit 2 focused on how computers talk to each other using networks. A <b>computing device</b> is any machine that can run programs, like phones or laptops.
            A <b>computer network</b> is a group of these devices connected together. Data travels along a <b>path</b>, which is the route it takes to get from one device to another.
            Devices follow a <b>protocol</b>, which is just an agreed set of rules so they can communicate. The internet is <b>fault tolerant</b>, meaning it keeps working even if some parts break.
            It also has <b>scalability</b>, which means it can grow to handle more users and devices.
            <b>Bandwidth</b> is how much data can be sent per second, and a <b>URL</b> is an easy-to-remember address for a website.

        <h2>5G & Beyond</h2>
        <p>
            New network technology like 5G and future 6G will make the internet much faster and reduce delays.
            This means we’ll be able to do things like stream videos instantly, use virtual reality more smoothly, and connect more devices at the same time.
            It will also help bring the internet to rural areas that don’t have good service yet.
